Welcome to our ASP Final Project Code Base

ASP_Project_Driver.m 
Handles most of the processing. Contains different sections of experimentation.

Helper Functions
All algorithms are implemented in their own functions. 
Metric computations also implemented in their own function
Algorithms implemented:
LMS,
NLMS,
RLS,
AFA,
Wavelet Denoising combined with the above

Process_All_Audio.m
Driver for loops through and computing statistic over all audio files.

Output_Audio
Sample audio files after processing of each algorithm using parameters mentioned in the report.
Original clean and noisy audio included. 
Include Music, Speech with white gaussian noise
Music with crowd noise
Music with Wavelet ANC method with white gaussian noise.
